# Pandas : Pandas is a Python library used for data manipulation and analysis.

# Key points:

# It provides data structures like Series (1D) and DataFrame (2D tables).
# Commonly used to read, clean, transform, analyze, and export data.
# Supports files such as CSV, Excel, SQL, JSON, etc.
# Widely used in data analysis, data science, and web scraping. 

# Example:

# import pandas as pd

# data = {
#     "Name": ["Alex", "Akash"],
#     "Age": [20, 22]
# }

# df = pd.DataFrame(data)
# print(df) 



# NumPy (Numerical Python) is a Python library used for numerical computing and mathematical operations.

# Key points:

# Provides support for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
# Much faster than Python lists for numerical calculations.
# Includes functions for mathematics, statistics, linear algebra, and more.
# Widely used in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing.

# Example:

# import numpy as np

# arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
# print(arr)
# print(arr * 2) 




# In terminal -

# pip install pandas
# pip install numpy 

# Now -

# import pandas as pd
# import numpy as np

# data = pd.read_excel('customer_data.xlsx')
# data.head()
