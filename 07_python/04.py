# Introduction to Binary Search

# Key requirement
# The list must be sorted (ascending or descending).

# How binary search works (idea)
# Find the middle element.
# Compare it with the target:
# If equal → found.
# If target is smaller → search the left half.
# If target is larger → search the right half.
# Repeat until found or the range becomes empty.
