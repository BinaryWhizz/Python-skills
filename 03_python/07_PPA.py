# PPA 1
# Accept a positive integer n as input and print the first n positive
# integers, one number on each line.

# n = int(input())
# i = 0

# while n>=i:
#     print(i)
#     i += 1
    

# PPA 2
# Accept a positive integer n as input and print all the factors of n, one
# number on each line.

# n = int(input()) 

# for i in range(1,n):
#     if n%i == 0:
#         print(i)
#     else:
#         pass

# or , if the number is negative 

# n = int(input()) 

# for i in range(0,n,-1):
#     print(i)


# PPA 3
# Accept two positive integers a and b as input. Print the sum of all
# integers in the range [1000, 2000], endpoints inclusive, that are
# divisible by both a and b. If you find no number satisfying this
# condition in the given range, then print 0.
